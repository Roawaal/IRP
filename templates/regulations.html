    <p>CAP (EU's Common Agricultural Policy) is a system of agricultural subsidies and programmes covering farming, environmental measures and rural development.
        Having left the EU, the UK is now free to design its own agricultural policy to replace the CAP, although key elements of the CAP-based system currently remain in place.</p>
    <p>Before Brexit, the government promised to match EU funding.<sup><a href="#note3">3</a></sup> <p class="underline">However, the critical question remains: Were these promises fulfilled?<p></p>

            <h3>Wales</h3>
            <p>In December 2020, the Welsh government published <a href="https://www.gov.wales/sites/default/files/consultations/2020-12/agriculture-wales-bill-white-paper.pdf">the Agriculture (Wales) white paper</a>. As in England, the concept of public money for public goods is described as central to the new ‘Sustainable Land Management policy framework’, which is also being developed through a process of co-design. </p>
            <p>Wales’ rural affairs minister, Lesley Griffiths, has pledged to maintain the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) at current levels for 2022 – provided the Welsh government receives the same funding from the UK government for agriculture.</p>
            <p>However, the UK Government has failed to honour repeated promises that Wales would not be a penny worse off.</p>

            <p>In August 2020, the Scottish parliament passed the Agriculture (Retained EU Law and Data) (Scotland) Act, which gave ministers the power to alter the inherited CAP regime.
                In August 2021, the Scottish government consulted on the future of agricultural support in Scotland and established the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/groups/agriculture-reform-implementation-oversight-board/">Agricultural Reform Implementation Board</a> (made up of farmers, crofters and conservationists) to advise on policy development.</p>
