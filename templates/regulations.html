    <p>CAP (EU's Common Agricultural Policy) is a system of agricultural subsidies and programmes covering farming, environmental measures and rural development.
        Having left the EU, the UK is now free to design its own agricultural policy to replace the CAP, although key elements of the CAP-based system currently remain in place.</p>
    <p>Before Brexit, the government promised to match EU funding. <p class="underline">However, the critical question remains: Were these promises fulfilled?<p></p>

                <p>The CAP is divided into two pillars. Pillar 1 covers direct support and market supports, and rural development is in Pillar 2.</p>
            <p>Direct support consists of payments granted directly to farmers and provides baseline income support and operates as a safety net in cases of market disturbances.<br />
