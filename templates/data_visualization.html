    <p>For UK agriculture, 2020 was marked not only by Brexit but also by Covid-19 pandemic.
        In the following years, the UK also experienced significant global events and
        extreme weather(heatwave/storms/......) conditions<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup></a>.

        <p>Since the UK left the EU, the arrangements for how the UK trades with the EU have changed.
            The following section will apply data to display the impact of Brexit on UK's overseas trade in agricultural stuff, excluding other goods like material manufactures or fuels.</p>
        <p>Moreover, it will pay more attention to annual changes rather than quarterly's, as the seasonal fluctuations in UK agricultural are significant. For example, during the summer months,
            the UK can grow plenty of its own produce like lettuces and soft berries such as raspberries and strawberries, but when the weather turns colder Britain is forced to rely much more on imports from the EU.</p>

        <p>Since the year 2000, there has been a generally consistent upward trend in imports, exports and trade balance.
            It can be witnessed from the chart that the trade deficit in 2020 was the largest in the past 23 years and over the longer term it has widened by 45.93% from £20.01 billion (in 2000) to £33.20 billion (in 2022) in real terms.
        </p>
        <p> Focused on 2019-2021,there was a decline observed in both imports and exports. Nevertheless, by the year 2022, both of them rebounded to the levels seen in 2019(pre-pandemic and pre-Brexit).
            The real terms value of exports was 13% higher(around £2.8 billion) in 2022 than 2021 but remains 3.1%(around £0.8 billion) below 2019. Meanwhile, the real terms value of imports was £3.0 billion or 5.3% higher in 2022 than 2021 but £0.4 billion or 0.7% lower than 2019.

        <p>Mostly the trend of the data is similar to the figure above and the growth of 'exports to EU' is not obvious due to the lower values.</p>
        <p>It's evident that the EU is a crucial destination for the UK's food imports. However, comparatively, exports the EU do not constitute as high a proportion as imports to it.
           Meanwhile, this chart can also verify this sentence "The EU remains the U.K.'s largest trade partner, providing more than 70 percent of the U.K.'s agricultural imports"<sup><a href="#note3">5</a></sup></p>
        <p>Based on the above data and for better analyzing the changes from 2019 to 2022, I created a chart below：</p>

            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Exports to EU vs. Exports to Non-EU:<br />
            Both regions experienced a decline and saw a rebound from 2019-2020, 2021-2022 respectively.
            Exports to the EU dropped significantly (-14.76%), while exports to non-EU countries turned positive (+8.90%) from 2021 to 2020.
            From 2019 to 2022, over four years, exports to non-EU countries showed a growth (+10.89%), while exports to the EU decreased (-11.98%),
            suggesting a possible diversification of the UK's export markets or a shift in trade patterns post-Brexit.
        </p>
        <p>Imports from EU vs. Imports from Non-EU:<br />
            Annual change rates for both of them have been opposite over the past four years and
            when looking at the change from 2019 to 2022, imports from non-EU countries increased (+6.89%), while imports from the EU decreased (-3.66%).
            It indicates a possiblely new balance of trade relations to new trade regulations after Brexit.
