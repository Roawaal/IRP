    <p>Brexit officially took place at 23:00 GMT on 31 January 2020 (00:00 1 February 2020 CET).
     After 4 years, British people are coming to realize the effects of Brexit on their own lives and livelihoods.
    <p>Agriculture plays a significant economic role in the UK, supplying the agri-food sector and engaging in direct sales.
        The impact of Brexit is sure to have vast implications on the role of agriculture in the UK, as the EU's Common Agricultural Policy
        has shaped UK farming policies for decades since the 1970s.</p>
    <p>This project aims to explore Brexit's wide-ranging effects on agricultral using interactive spatial data analysis technologies to sense trends,
        analyze the dynamic changes in social media topics and sentiments, understanding public opinion trends.</p>

    <h3 class="h3-style">2000-2022 UK Gross domestic product at 2024 dollar prices<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> and the percentages of 2012-2022 agricultureâ€™s contribution to the UK economy (Gross Value Added at basic prices)<sup><a href="#note1">2</a></sup></h3>
    <div id="container3" class="agri-style">{% include 'agri_gdp.html' %}</div>
    <p>The chart reveals that the percentages of UK's agricultural contribution to the total GDP fluctuates between 0.55% and 0.8%, with the highest value 0.76% in 2022
        and the next highest in 2014 0.75%. Between 2014 and 2018, despite minor fluctuations, the overall trend was a decline, followed by a rebound and continuous
        growth from 2018 to 2022. This seems to suggest that Brexit had a minimal or even positive impact on the development of UK agriculture, despite 2020 witnessing
        the lowest total GDP in recent years.

    <p>Focused on adjusted data, income generally rose between 2000 and 2022 despite some data oscillating. In 2022, income peaked at 7.94 billion British pounds.
        After experiencing declines in the previous two years, 2016's TIFF surged with a significant growth rate of 55.11% and in next 3 years, TIFF generally decreased, though there was a minor increase in 2019.
        Comparatively, the decrease in 2020, Brexit year, was 5.19% from 2019, followed by continuous growth in the subsequent two years, with increase rate 29.13% and 11.03% respectively.
