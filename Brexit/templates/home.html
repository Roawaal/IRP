        <p><i><span style="color: #055705;font-size:25px;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit">Brexit</a></span></i> &nbsp;officially took place at 23:00 GMT on 31 January 2020 (00:00 1 February 2020 CET), marked the end of the UK’s longstanding 47-year alliance with the European Union.<sup><a href="#note100">1</a></sup>
     Now, after 4 years, British people are coming to realize the effects of Brexit on their own lives and livelihoods.
    <p>Agriculture holds a significant economic position in the UK, providing for the agri-food sector and participating in direct sales. The impacts of Brexit are expected to profoundly affect the role of agriculture in the UK, given that the EU's Common Agricultural Policy has shaped UK farming policies since the 1970s.</p>
    <p>This project aims to explore Brexit's wide-ranging effects on agricultral using data analysis technologies to ......</p>
    <section id="section1">
        <p></p>
        <p>Below section will apply datasets of UK's GDP, agriculture’s economic contribution and TIFF to discuss this general statement: <i><span style="color: #055705">Brexit’s overall effect on the UK economy and people’s living standards appears to be negative but uncertain, according to economists.<sup><a href="#note200">2</a></sup></span></i></p>
        <p>The data for the subsequent charts only extends to the year 2022 due to the delayed update of some official sources. Currently, the majority of these sources have available data only up to the year 2022. Moreover, only four years since the UK quit the EU, the exact costs remain unknown because the effects have not been immediate.</p>

    <div id="container3" class="zero-style">{% include '0_agri_gdp.html' %}</div>
    <p>The chart reveals that the percentages of UK's agricultural contribution to the total GDP fluctuates between 0.55% and 0.8%, with the highest value 0.76% in 2022
        and the next highest in 2014 0.75%. Between 2014 and 2018, despite minor fluctuations, the overall trend was a decline, followed by a rebound and continuous
        growth from 2018 to 2022. &nbsp;<i><span style="color: #055705">This seems to suggest that Brexit had a minimal or even positive impact on the development of UK agriculture, despite 2020 witnessing
            the lowest total GDP in recent years.</span></i>

    <p>Focused on adjusted data, income generally rose between 2000 and 2022 despite some data oscillating. In 2022, income peaked at 7.94 billion British pounds.
        After experiencing declines in the previous two years, 2016's TIFF surged with a significant growth rate of 55.11% and in next 3 years, TIFF generally decreased, though there was a minor increase in 2019.
        Comparatively, the decrease in 2020, Brexit year, was 5.19% from 2019, followed by continuous growth in the subsequent two years, with increase rate 29.13% and 11.03% respectively.
        &nbsp;<i><span style="color: #055705">Therefore, while Brexit initially led to a downturn in TIFF, the agricultural sector showed signs of recovery in the years that followed.</span></i></p>

    <p>For UK agriculture, 2020 was marked not only by Brexit but also by Covid-19 pandemic.
        In the following years, the UK also experienced significant global events and
        extreme weather(heatwave/storms/......) conditions<sup><a href="#note4">4</a></sup></a>.</p>
            <p>Clearly, farm businesses have been affected by more than just Brexit over the past seven years – the global pandemic, political upheavals in Westminster and the war in Ukraine have all played a major part in farming’s fortunes.</p>

    <p>Since the UK left the EU, the arrangements for how the UK trades with the EU have changed.&nbsp;
        <i><span style="color: #055705">The following section will apply data to display the impact of Brexit on UK's overseas trade in agricultural stuff, excluding other goods like material manufactures or fuels.</span></i></p>
    <p>Moreover, it will pay more attention to annual changes rather than quarterly's, as the seasonal fluctuations in UK agricultural are significant. For example, during the summer months,
        the UK can grow plenty of its own produce like lettuces and soft berries such as raspberries and strawberries, but when the weather turns colder Britain is forced to rely much more on imports from the EU.<sup><a href="#note300">3</a></sup></p>

    <p>Since the year 2000, there has been a generally consistent upward trend in imports, exports and trade balance.
        It can be witnessed from the chart that the trade deficit in 2020 was the largest in the past 23 years and over the longer term it has widened by 45.93% from £20.01 billion (in 2000) to £33.20 billion (in 2022) in real terms.
    </p>
    <p> Focused on 2019-2021,there was a decline observed in both imports and exports. Nevertheless, by the year 2022, both of them rebounded to the levels seen in 2019(pre-pandemic and pre-Brexit).
        The real terms value of exports was 13% higher(around £2.8 billion) in 2022 than 2021 but remains 3.1%(around £0.8 billion) below 2019. Meanwhile, the real terms value of imports was £3.0 billion or 5.3% higher in 2022 than 2021 but £0.4 billion or 0.7% lower than 2019.
    </p>
    <p>Beverages:the value of imports was greater than the value of exports in every broad category of food, animal feed, and drink except for beverages, which had a trade surplus largely due to exports of Scotch Whisky. https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/649da925bb13dc0012b2e38a/Independent_Review_into_Labour_Shortages_in_the_Food_Supply_Chain_June_2023.pdf</p>

    <p>The green line indicates imports from the EU, which similarly to blue line 'exports to the EU', rises stably from 2000, reaching its peak in 2019. The subsequent years see a reduction in imports, with a slight recovery noted in 2022, although not to the same extent as exports.
            The red line, which defines imports from non-EU countries, displays the least growth over time. It shows a slow and relatively stable increase, with little fluctuations but no significant peaks or troughs, ending slightly higher in 2022 compared to 2000.
            The orange line 'exports to non-EU countries' beginning is lower than exports to the EU in 2000 but following a similar positive trend over the two decades. While there's a slight flattening in growth around 2019, the line raises again in 2022, exceeding the pre-2019 level.
    </p>
    <p>It's evident that the EU is a crucial destination for the UK's food imports. However, comparatively, exports the EU do not constitute as high a proportion as imports to it.
        Meanwhile, this chart can also verify this sentence <i><span style="color: #055705;">"The EU remains the U.K.'s largest trade partner, providing more than 70 percent of the U.K.'s agricultural imports"</span></i><sup><a href="#note400">4</a></sup></p>

            Exports to the EU dropped significantly (-14.76%), while exports to non-EU countries turned positive (+8.90%) from 2021 to 2020.
            From 2019 to 2022, over four years, exports to non-EU countries showed a growth (+10.89%), while exports to the EU decreased (-11.98%),
            suggesting a possible diversification of the UK's export markets or a shift in trade patterns post-Brexit.

    <p>Imports from EU vs. Imports from Non-EU:<br />
            Annual change rates for both of them have been opposite over the past four years and
            when looking at the change from 2019 to 2022, imports from non-EU countries increased (+6.89%), while imports from the EU decreased (-3.66%).
            It indicates a possiblely new balance of trade relations to new trade regulations after Brexit.

    <p>CAP (EU's Common Agricultural Policy) is a system of agricultural subsidies and programmes covering farming, environmental measures and rural development.
        Having left the EU, the UK is now free to design its own agricultural policy to replace the CAP, although key elements of the CAP-based system currently remain in place.</p>
    <p>Before Brexit, the government promised to match EU funding.<sup><a href="#note11">11</a></sup>
    <br />Boris Johnson’s 2019 election manifesto had promised that post-Brexit replacement funding would “at a minimum match the size” of EU funds in “each nation” of the UK.

    <p>The CAP is divided into two pillars. Pillar 1 covers direct support and market supports, and rural development is in Pillar 2, contained European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and Co-financing</p>
    <p>Direct support consists of payments granted directly to farmers and provides baseline income support and operates as a safety net in cases of market disturbances.

    <p>When the UK was a member of the EU, the four governments were responsible for administering subsidies according to EU rules. Now, outside the EU, these administrations have the flexibility to develop their own subsidy schemes.
        <br />Below are some policies introduced by each region's governments and we'll see whether the funding is on the same level before Brexit. Moreover, the Chancellor has confirmed nearly £3 billion of funding for 2020 to support farmers once the UK leaves the EU on 30 December 2019 and the funding is spread across two financial years.<sup><a href="#note13">13</a></sup>

    <p>But Mr Foster hit back, arguing there was a “problem with uptake” and blaming employers for failing to sign up to a visa scheme to bring in workers.

            <p>According to the survey, some 70% of the farmers who grow cereals said Brexit had been negative for their businesses, while 76% of oilseed rape growers felt that way.
                Similarly, 68% of farmers with beef cattle, dairy cows or sheep had a negative perception.
                Perhaps not surprisingly, the two sectors that were even more negative were those growing vegetables (81%) and those keeping pigs (79%).</p>

    <p>“There may well be grants and subsidies but we don’t know what they are going to be yet. We know they have said public money for public good.
        But it doesn’t mean anything, that is just a slogan.” By Jeremy Clarkson</p>

    <h5>Notes: The common agricultural policy (cap), which Britain leaves on January 1st after 47 years,
        has been a lousy deal for the country.</h5>
