    <p>Brexit officially took place at 23:00 GMT on 31 January 2020 (00:00 1 February 2020 CET).
     After 4 years, British people are coming to realize the effects of Brexit on their own lives and livelihoods.
    <p>Agriculture plays a significant economic role in the UK, supplying the agri-food sector and engaging in direct sales.
        The impact of Brexit is sure to have vast implications on the role of agriculture in the UK, as the EU's Common Agricultural Policy
        has shaped UK farming policies for decades since the 1970s.</p>
    <p>This project aims to explore Brexit's wide-ranging effects on agricultral using interactive spatial data analysis technologies to sense trends,
        analyze the dynamic changes in social media topics and sentiments, understanding public opinion trends.</p>


    <h3 class="h3-style">2000-2022 UK Gross domestic product at 2024 dollar prices<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> and the percentages of 2012-2022 agriculture’s contribution to the UK economy (Gross Value Added at basic prices)<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup></h3>
    <div id="container3" class="zero-style">{% include '0_agri_gdp.html' %}</div>
    <p>The chart reveals that the percentages of UK's agricultural contribution to the total GDP fluctuates between 0.55% and 0.8%, with the highest value 0.76% in 2022
        and the next highest in 2014 0.75%. Between 2014 and 2018, despite minor fluctuations, the overall trend was a decline, followed by a rebound and continuous
        growth from 2018 to 2022. This seems to suggest that Brexit had a minimal or even positive impact on the development of UK agriculture, despite 2020 witnessing
        the lowest total GDP in recent years.
    </p>

    <div id="container4" class="one-style">{% include '1_2000_2020TIFF.html' %}</div>

    <p>Focused on adjusted data, income generally rose between 2000 and 2022 despite some data oscillating. In 2022, income peaked at 7.94 billion British pounds.
        After experiencing declines in the previous two years, 2016's TIFF surged with a significant growth rate of 55.11% and in next 3 years, TIFF generally decreased, though there was a minor increase in 2019.
        Comparatively, the decrease in 2020, Brexit year, was 5.19% from 2019, followed by continuous growth in the subsequent two years, with increase rate 29.13% and 11.03% respectively.

    <p>For UK agriculture, 2020 was marked not only by Brexit but also by Covid-19 pandemic.
        In the following years, the UK also experienced significant global events and
        extreme weather(heatwave/storms/......) conditions<sup><a href="#note4">4</a></sup></a>.
    </p>
    <div id="event" class="two-style">{% include '2_events.html' %}</div>
    <p>Although Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland are important contributors to Uk agricultural output in monetary terms,
        their datasets are not as comprehensive or updated as English datasets. So we'll focus on 2017-2022 England. </p>

    <p>Since the UK left the EU, the arrangements for how the UK trades with the EU have changed.
        The following section will apply data to display the impact of Brexit on UK's overseas trade in agricultural stuff, excluding other goods like material manufactures or fuels.</p>
    <p>Moreover, it will pay more attention to annual changes rather than quarterly's, as the seasonal fluctuations in UK agricultural are significant. For example, during the summer months,
        the UK can grow plenty of its own produce like lettuces and soft berries such as raspberries and strawberries, but when the weather turns colder Britain is forced to rely much more on imports from the EU.</p>

    <p>Since the year 2000, there has been a generally consistent upward trend in imports, exports and trade balance.
        It can be witnessed from the chart that the trade deficit in 2020 was the largest in the past 23 years and over the longer term it has widened by 45.93% from £20.01 billion (in 2000) to £33.20 billion (in 2022) in real terms.
    </p>
    <p> Focused on 2019-2021,there was a decline observed in both imports and exports. Nevertheless, by the year 2022, both of them rebounded to the levels seen in 2019(pre-pandemic and pre-Brexit).
        The real terms value of exports was 13% higher(around £2.8 billion) in 2022 than 2021 but remains 3.1%(around £0.8 billion) below 2019. Meanwhile, the real terms value of imports was £3.0 billion or 5.3% higher in 2022 than 2021 but £0.4 billion or 0.7% lower than 2019.

    <p>The green line indicates imports from the EU, which similarly to blue line 'exports to the EU', rises stably from 2000, reaching its peak in 2019. The subsequent years see a reduction in imports, with a slight recovery noted in 2022, although not to the same extent as exports.
            The red line, which defines imports from non-EU countries, displays the least growth over time. It shows a slow and relatively stable increase, with little fluctuations but no significant peaks or troughs, ending slightly higher in 2022 compared to 2000.
            The orange line 'exports to non-EU countries' beginning is lower than exports to the EU in 2000 but following a similar positive trend over the two decades. While there's a slight flattening in growth around 2019, the line raises again in 2022, exceeding the pre-2019 level.
    </p>
    <p>It's evident that the EU is a crucial destination for the UK's food imports. However, comparatively, exports the EU do not constitute as high a proportion as imports to it.
        Meanwhile, this chart can also verify this sentence <i><span style="color: #055705;">"The EU remains the U.K.'s largest trade partner, providing more than 70 percent of the U.K.'s agricultural imports"</span></i><sup><a href="#note8">8</a></sup></p>

    <p>Exports to EU vs. Exports to Non-EU:<br />
            Both regions experienced a decline and saw a rebound from 2019-2020, 2021-2022 respectively.
            Exports to the EU dropped significantly (-14.76%), while exports to non-EU countries turned positive (+8.90%) from 2021 to 2020.
            From 2019 to 2022, over four years, exports to non-EU countries showed a growth (+10.89%), while exports to the EU decreased (-11.98%),
            suggesting a possible diversification of the UK's export markets or a shift in trade patterns post-Brexit.
    </p>
    <p>Imports from EU vs. Imports from Non-EU:<br />
            Annual change rates for both of them have been opposite over the past four years and
            when looking at the change from 2019 to 2022, imports from non-EU countries increased (+6.89%), while imports from the EU decreased (-3.66%).
            It indicates a possiblely new balance of trade relations to new trade regulations after Brexit.
